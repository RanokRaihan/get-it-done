    question: "Is my payment secure?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We use a secure Escrow system. Your money is held safely by GetItDone and is only released to the helper once you confirm the task is completed to your satisfaction.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not happy with the work?",
    answer:
      "You are in control. Do not release the payment if the work isn't done right. Request revisions directly, or contact our Dispute Resolution team for a refund.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it cost money to post a task?",
    answer:
      "No, posting a task is 100% free. You only pay the agreed amount when you hire someone.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I pick the right helper?",
    answer:
      "Review their profile! You can see their completion rate, star rating, and detailed text reviews from previous clients before you accept their offer.",
  },

const helperFaqs = [
  {
    question: "When do I get paid?",
    answer:
      "Instantly. As soon as the Task Poster marks the job as 'Complete', the funds are released from escrow directly to your Wallet. You can withdraw to your bank anytime.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there fees for helpers?",
    answer:
      "We only make money when you do. Joining is free. We deduct a standard 15% service fee from the total task price to cover platform maintenance, insurance, and support.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be a professional?",
    answer:
      "Not necessarily! We have tasks for everyone—from moving boxes to expert plumbing. You just need to verify your identity to start.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be verified?",
    answer:
      "To become a 'Super Helper' and access high-value tasks, yes. You'll need to submit ID verification. For standard tasks, you can start immediately after building your profile.",
